Distinctive Theme README
========================
Author: Ken Corbett

Thank you for purchasing the Distinctive Theme for Twitter Bootstrap.
I hope you will love this theme as much as I have enjoyed creating it.
If you have any questions or issues feel free to reach out to me by email
at Kenneth.Corbett@gmail.com.



Usage
-----
Using the Distinctive theme is really quite easy, especially if you use a similar
file structure as in the theme files.  Just make sure you are including the
distinctive.css file after the bootstrap.css and responsive.css files and if you 
are going to use the file-upload styling be sure to include the bootstrap-fileupload.js
file.  The only other task is to put font-awesome files in the font folder and the
bg_texture.png is in the img folder and you are set.



Editing the Less Files
----------------------
If you want to tweak anything, all you need to do is copy the distinctive folder into 
the Twitter Bootstrap git project inside the less folder.  You can then make your
changes and use a less compiler on theme.less to build a custom version of distinctive.css.
